We got a ride, we got the night 
I got the bottle, you got the light 
We got the stars (stars) 
We got audio
We're gonna fly, we're getting high 
You got the moon dust, I got the sky 
We got the stars (stars) 
We got audio
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the song so sweet 
You gon' come home with me, oh
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the song so sweet 
You gon' come home with me, oh
Ay, ay 
That audio 
Play that audio 
That that
You got the heart, we got the soul 
Just when the world saying they got no hold 
Here comes the love 
We got audio (a-audio)
We flying high, superhero 
S on my chest, with my Marilyn Monroe 
Feel like a star (star) 
'Cause we got audio 
Make a go
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the song so sweet 
You gon' come home with me, oh
Make a go 
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the bomb bomb beat 
I'll give you melody 
Make the song so sweet 
You gon' come home with me, oh
Play that audio 
That, that 
Play that audio 
That that
